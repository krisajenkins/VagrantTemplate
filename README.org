* Vagrant Template

An outline of a Vagrant+Puppet server. A sketch for my reference, but
feel free to use it yourself.

** Usage

Install VirtualBox and Vagrant. Clone this repo. Type =vagrant up= and
make a cup of tea. When you return you'll have a basic server
running. =ssh localhost 2222= to connect.
